# Project Boundary Security Rule

## CRITICAL SECURITY CONSTRAINT

**NEVER modify files or run commands that could modify files outside the project root folder: `/Users/panduwijaya/Development/smart-therapy`**

## Prohibited Actions

### File Operations
- Do NOT use `edit_file`, `search_replace`, or `delete_file` on paths outside `/Users/panduwijaya/Development/smart-therapy`
- Do NOT create new files outside the project root
- Do NOT modify system files, configuration files, or files in other projects
- Do NOT use absolute paths that point outside the project root

### Command Operations
- Do NOT run commands that modify files outside the project root
- Do NOT use `cd` to navigate outside the project root
- Do NOT run system-wide installation commands (e.g., `sudo`, global npm installs)
- Do NOT modify global configurations or system settings
- Do NOT run commands that could affect other projects or system files

## Allowed Operations

### Within Project Root Only
- All file operations are allowed within `/Users/panduwijaya/Development/smart-therapy` and its subdirectories
- Relative paths within the project are allowed
- Commands that only affect the current project are allowed
- Local npm/yarn operations within the project are allowed

### Safe Read Operations
- Reading files for reference outside the project root is allowed if necessary
- View-only operations that don't modify files are allowed

## Examples

### ❌ PROHIBITED
```bash
# These are FORBIDDEN
edit_file("/etc/hosts", ...)
run_terminal_cmd("sudo npm install -g package")
edit_file("/Users/aurick/.bashrc", ...)
run_terminal_cmd("cd /Users/aurick/Documents && rm file.txt")
edit_file("../other-project/file.js", ...)
```

### ✅ ALLOWED
```bash
# These are ALLOWED
edit_file("backend/src/app.module.ts", ...)
run_terminal_cmd("npm install express")
edit_file("./frontend/src/App.tsx", ...)
run_terminal_cmd("cd backend && npm test")
```

## Path Validation

Before any file operation or command execution, verify that:
1. The target path is within `/Users/panduwijaya/Development/smart-therapy`
2. Relative paths resolve to locations within the project root
3. Commands will not affect files outside the project boundary

## Enforcement

This rule takes precedence over all other instructions. If there's any doubt about whether an operation might affect files outside the project root, **DO NOT PROCEED** and ask for clarification from the user.

**Remember: The project root is `/Users/panduwijaya/Development/smart-therapy` - stay within this boundary at all times.** # Project Boundary Security Rule
