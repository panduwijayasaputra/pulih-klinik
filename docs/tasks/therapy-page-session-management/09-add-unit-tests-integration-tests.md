# Task 09: Add Unit Tests and Integration Tests

## Overview
Create comprehensive test coverage for all therapy page components, hooks, and functionality to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Relevant Files
- `frontend/src/components/therapy/__tests__/` - Test files for therapy components
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/` - Test files for custom hooks
- `frontend/src/lib/api/__tests__/` - Test files for API functions
- `frontend/src/store/__tests__/` - Test files for state management
- `frontend/src/schemas/__tests__/` - Test files for validation schemas

## Tasks

### 9.1 Create unit tests for components
- [ ] Test all therapy page components
- [ ] Test session management functionality
- [ ] Test form validation and error handling
- [ ] Test responsive design and accessibility
- [ ] Test component integration and props

**Steps:**
1. Set up testing environment with Jest and React Testing Library
2. Create test files for all therapy components
3. Test component rendering with different props
4. Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions, etc.)
5. Test error states and loading states
6. Test responsive behavior with different screen sizes
7. Test accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
8. Test form validation and error messages
9. Test modal interactions and focus management
10. Test component integration with hooks and state
11. Add snapshot tests for UI consistency
12. Test edge cases and error scenarios

### 9.2 Create integration tests
- [ ] Test complete user workflows
- [ ] Test API integration and error scenarios
- [ ] Test navigation between pages
- [ ] Test session status transitions
- [ ] Test data synchronization

**Steps:**
1. Create integration test files for complete workflows
2. Test session creation and scheduling workflow
3. Test session status transitions (new → scheduled → started)
4. Test navigation between therapy and session pages
5. Test API integration with mock data
6. Test error scenarios and recovery
7. Test data synchronization and caching
8. Test form submission and validation flows
9. Test modal interactions and state management
10. Test responsive behavior across different devices
11. Test accessibility workflows with screen readers
12. Test performance with large datasets

### 9.3 Create hook tests
- [ ] Test useTherapy and useSession hooks
- [ ] Test state management functionality
- [ ] Test API client functions
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test data transformation and validation

**Steps:**
1. Create test files for all custom hooks
2. Test hook initialization and state management
3. Test API calls and data fetching
4. Test error handling and retry logic
5. Test data transformation and validation
6. Test optimistic updates and rollback
7. Test caching and invalidation logic
8. Test hook integration with components
9. Test edge cases and error scenarios
10. Test performance with different data sizes
11. Test hook cleanup and memory management
12. Test hook dependencies and re-renders

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components have comprehensive unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete user workflows
- [ ] Hook tests validate all functionality and edge cases
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 80% for all files
- [ ] Tests run efficiently and provide clear feedback
- [ ] Error scenarios are properly tested
- [ ] Accessibility features are tested
- [ ] Performance tests validate component efficiency
- [ ] Tests are maintainable and well-documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes test execution

## Dependencies
- Jest testing framework
- React Testing Library
- MSW for API mocking
- Testing utilities and helpers
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Estimated Time
- 9.1: 6-8 hours
- 9.2: 5-7 hours
- 9.3: 4-6 hours
- **Total: 15-21 hours**
