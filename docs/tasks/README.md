# Smart Therapy API Implementation Tasks

This directory contains detailed task breakdowns for implementing the Smart Therapy API endpoints.

## Task Files

### [Task 1.0: Create Missing Database Entities](./task-1-database-entities.md)
Create all missing database entities based on the comprehensive database schema including therapists, clients, consultations, therapy sessions, and assignment tracking.

### [Task 2.0: Set Up Authentication & JWT System](./task-2-authentication-jwt.md)
Implement comprehensive JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization and clinic-scoped access control.

### [Task 3.0: Create Core API Infrastructure](./task-3-core-infrastructure.md)
Set up shared infrastructure components including DTOs, interceptors, filters, and global configuration for consistent API behavior.

### [Task 4.0: Implement User & Clinic Management](./task-4-user-clinic-management.md)
Create user profile management and clinic administration endpoints with proper authorization and validation.

### [Task 5.0: Implement Therapist Management APIs](./task-5-therapist-management.md)
Create comprehensive therapist management system with CRUD operations, capacity management, and assignment functionality.

### [Task 6.0: Implement Client Management APIs](./task-6-client-management.md)
Create comprehensive client management system with demographic handling, status transitions, and assignment tracking.

### [Task 7.0: Implement Therapy Session Management](./task-7-session-management.md)
Create therapy session and consultation management system with AI prediction support and flexible form handling.

### [Task 8.0: Add Global Error Handling & Validation](./task-8-error-handling.md)
Implement comprehensive error handling, validation, and business rule enforcement across the entire API.

### [Task 9.0: Implement Health Monitoring](./task-9-health-monitoring.md)
Set up health check and monitoring endpoints for system status, database connectivity, and operational monitoring.

## Implementation Order

The tasks are designed to be implemented in sequence:

1. **Database Entities** - Foundation for all other features
2. **Authentication & JWT** - Security layer for all protected endpoints  
3. **Core Infrastructure** - Shared components used by all modules
4. **User & Clinic Management** - Basic profile and clinic administration
5. **Therapist Management** - Professional staff management
6. **Client Management** - Client lifecycle and demographics
7. **Session Management** - Core therapy functionality
8. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive validation and error management
9. **Health Monitoring** - Operational monitoring and status

## Success Criteria

Each task includes specific success criteria and dependencies. The complete implementation should provide:

- **Multi-tenant architecture** with clinic-scoped data access
- **Role-based authorization** (Administrator, Clinic Admin, Therapist)
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for all system changes
- **Status transition workflows** for client management
- **Pagination and filtering** for all list endpoints
- **Standardized API responses** matching documentation
- **Indonesian-specific validations** and business rules

## Testing Strategy

- Each service should have corresponding unit tests
- Controllers should have integration tests
- Use Jest for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies (database, file upload)

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require JWT authentication except health checks
- Role-based authorization with clinic scoping
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
