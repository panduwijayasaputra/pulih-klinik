# Product Requirements Document: Indonesian Hypnotherapy AI System

## Introduction/Overview

The Indonesian Hypnotherapy AI System is a comprehensive web platform designed to revolutionize the workflow of licensed Indonesian hypnotherapists through a role-based management system. The system transforms the traditional 2-hour manual session planning process into a streamlined 15-minute AI-assisted workflow, while maintaining cultural appropriateness and professional standards.

**Problem Statement:** Indonesian hypnotherapists currently spend 2+ hours manually planning sessions, creating scripts, and adapting techniques to cultural contexts. This time-intensive process reduces their capacity to serve clients and increases operational costs. Additionally, clinics lack efficient systems for managing therapists and client assignments.

**Solution:** An AI-powered platform with role-based access control that enables clinic administrators to manage therapists and clients, while providing therapists with automated assessment analysis, technique recommendation, and script generation incorporating Indonesian cultural considerations.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Session Planning Time:** Decrease manual planning from 2 hours to 15 minutes per session
2. **Improve Client Outcomes:** Enhance therapeutic effectiveness through data-driven technique selection
3. **Increase Therapist Capacity:** Enable therapists to serve 30% more clients through workflow optimization
4. **Streamline Clinic Management:** Provide clinic admins with efficient tools for therapist and client management
5. **Maintain Cultural Sensitivity:** Ensure all recommendations and scripts are culturally appropriate for Indonesian clients
6. **Ensure Professional Standards:** Maintain therapist autonomy and decision-making authority
7. **Achieve High Adoption Rate:** Target 80% adoption rate among Indonesian clinics within 12 months
