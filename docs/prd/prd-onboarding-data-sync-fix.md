# Product Requirements Document: Onboarding Data Synchronization Fix

## Introduction/Overview

The current onboarding flow suffers from two critical issues: infinite validation loops that cause performance problems and poor user experience, and the inability to detect when clinic data is deleted from the database while users are in the onboarding process. This PRD outlines a comprehensive solution to resolve both issues while maintaining a smooth user experience.

**Problem Statement:** Users can get stuck in infinite `/auth/me` API call loops, and when clinic data is deleted from the database, the system fails to detect this change and redirect users appropriately, leaving them on incorrect onboarding steps.

**Goal:** Implement a robust data synchronization system that prevents infinite loops while ensuring users are always on the correct onboarding step based on their current data state.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate infinite validation loops** - Prevent the system from making endless `/auth/me` API calls
2. **Detect clinic deletion in real-time** - Automatically redirect users when their clinic data is removed
3. **Maintain smooth user experience** - Ensure transitions between onboarding steps are seamless
4. **Provide transparent feedback** - Show users when data validation is happening
5. **Enable manual data refresh** - Allow users to manually refresh their data when needed

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a clinic admin**, I want the onboarding process to work smoothly without getting stuck in loading loops, so that I can complete my clinic setup efficiently.

2. **As a clinic admin**, I want to be automatically redirected to the correct onboarding step if my clinic data is deleted, so that I don't get confused about where I am in the process.

3. **As a clinic admin**, I want to see when the system is validating my data, so that I understand what's happening during the onboarding process.

4. **As a clinic admin**, I want to be able to manually refresh my data if something seems wrong, so that I can resolve data synchronization issues myself.

### Secondary User Stories

5. **As a system administrator**, I want the onboarding system to be performant and not make unnecessary API calls, so that the system remains responsive.

6. **As a developer**, I want clear error handling and logging for data synchronization issues, so that I can debug problems effectively.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Data Synchronization

1. **FR-1: Prevent Infinite Loops**
   - The system must not trigger validation calls in response to validation results
   - Validation must only be triggered by user actions or explicit system events
   - The system must implement proper dependency management in React useEffect hooks

2. **FR-2: Smart Validation Triggers**
   - The system must validate data when entering critical onboarding steps (subscription, payment)
   - The system must validate data when it becomes stale (5+ minutes old)
   - The system must not validate on every step change to prevent loops

3. **FR-3: Clinic Deletion Detection**
   - The system must detect when clinic data is removed from the database
   - The system must automatically redirect users to the clinic form step when clinic is deleted
   - The system must clear cached clinic data when deletion is detected

4. **FR-4: Manual Data Refresh**
   - The system must provide a refresh button on the onboarding page
   - The system must allow users to manually trigger data validation
   - The system must show loading state during manual refresh

### User Interface Requirements

5. **FR-5: Validation Status Indicators**
   - The system must show a loading indicator when validating data
   - The system must display error messages when validation fails
   - The system must show success feedback when validation completes

6. **FR-6: Error Handling**
   - The system must display user-friendly error messages for validation failures
   - The system must provide retry options for failed validations
   - The system must log detailed error information for debugging

### Performance Requirements

7. **FR-7: Response Time**
   - Data validation must complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
   - The system must not block user interactions during validation
   - The system must implement proper loading states

8. **FR-8: API Efficiency**
   - The system must not make redundant API calls
   - The system must implement proper caching mechanisms
   - The system must respect rate limiting and retry policies

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time WebSocket connections** - We will not implement real-time data synchronization
2. **Complex caching mechanisms** - We will keep caching simple and straightforward
3. **Database-level triggers** - We will handle detection at the application level
4. **Automatic retry with exponential backoff** - We will use simple retry mechanisms
5. **Real-time notifications** - We will not implement push notifications for data changes
6. **Advanced error recovery** - We will keep error handling simple and user-friendly

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Refresh Button**: Add a subtle refresh button to the onboarding header that users can click to manually validate their data
- **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during validation without blocking the UI
- **Error Messages**: Display clear, actionable error messages when validation fails
- **Status Indicators**: Show validation status (idle, validating, success, error) in a non-intrusive way

### Component Structure

- **OnboardingFlow**: Main component that orchestrates the onboarding process
- **ValidationStatus**: New component to show validation status and controls
- **ErrorBoundary**: Enhanced error boundary for onboarding-specific errors

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Architecture

- **State Management**: Use Zustand stores for auth and onboarding state
- **Validation Logic**: Implement smart validation triggers in OnboardingFlow component
- **Error Handling**: Use existing error handling patterns with enhanced user feedback
- **Performance**: Implement proper React useEffect dependency management

### Backend Integration

- **API Endpoints**: Use existing `/auth/me` endpoint for data validation
- **Error Responses**: Handle 401/404 responses appropriately for deleted data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect existing rate limiting on auth endpoints

### Dependencies

- **React Hooks**: useEffect, useState, useCallback for state management
- **Zustand**: For global state management
- **Existing Components**: Leverage existing UI components and patterns

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics

1. **Zero infinite loops** - No more endless `/auth/me` API calls in console logs
2. **Accurate step detection** - Users are redirected to correct onboarding steps when clinic is deleted
3. **Response time** - Data validation completes within 2 seconds
4. **User satisfaction** - Smooth onboarding experience without confusion

### Secondary Metrics

1. **Error rate reduction** - Decrease in onboarding-related support tickets
2. **Performance improvement** - Reduced API call volume and improved page load times
3. **Developer experience** - Clearer debugging information and error logs

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Fixes (High Priority)
- Fix infinite loop issues in OnboardingFlow useEffect dependencies
- Implement smart validation triggers for critical steps
- Add clinic deletion detection and automatic redirection

### Phase 2: User Experience (Medium Priority)
- Add validation status indicators
- Implement manual refresh functionality
- Enhance error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3: Polish (Low Priority)
- Add comprehensive logging and debugging tools
- Implement performance optimizations
- Add comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

## Open Questions

1. **Validation Frequency**: Should we validate on every step transition or only on critical steps?
2. **Error Recovery**: What should happen if validation fails multiple times in a row?
3. **User Notification**: Should we notify users when their data is automatically refreshed?
4. **Performance Monitoring**: How should we monitor the performance of the new validation system?
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Do we need to maintain compatibility with existing onboarding flows?
